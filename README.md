# 🧪 Learning Log

Welcome to my living log.  
This repository is my practice space where I document what I’m currently learning in web and mobile development.  
It’s not a polished portfolio — it’s a **lab** where I experiment with technologies, workflows, and books.

## 🧪 Gitflow

This repository is also my playground for practicing **Gitflow**.  
Branches I use:

- `main` → stable and production-ready
- `develop` → continuous integration of features
- `feature/*` → new practices or projects
- `release/*` → preparing a stable version
